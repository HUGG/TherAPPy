Thermochronometer Age Prediction codes in Python

The aim of this repository is to host a library of thermochronology model codes and model-data comparison that can be easily coupled with geoscientific model codes.

The functionality of the code is demonstrated in a jupyer notebook [therappy_test.ipynb](therappy_test.ipynb). The thermochron model libraries can be found in the subdirectory [lib](lib)

The code currently includes the following models:
- The Dodson (1973) closure age model for a range of minterals and thermochronometers with parameters from Reiners and Brandon (2006)
- The Ketcham (2007) apatite fission track annealing model

The code is under heavy development. Get in touch with us if you would like to contribute or have suggestions for changes.
